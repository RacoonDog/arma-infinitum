# Arma Infinitum

Arma Infinitum, meaning 'Infinity Weapons' in latin, is a Minecraft Fabric mod who's main goal is to allow enchantments to be compatible with as many items as possible and make said enchantments work beyond the original maximum level.

Due to the fact this could very easily end up completely breaking any sort of balance in fights, enchantments beyond the scope of what is capable in vanilla are only achievable through commands by default.

## Known Issues

- Maximum projectile thrown at once is capped at 255.
- 'Maximum sound pool size 247 reached' error message upon using very high multishot levels.
